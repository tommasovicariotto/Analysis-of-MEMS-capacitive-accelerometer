# Analysis_of_MEMS_vibratory_gyroscope
This project was developed at CentraleSupélec Paris and involved reverse-engineering a STMicroelectronics’ 3-axis capacitive accelerometer. 
In summary, we created a realistic model of the sensor using MEMS+ and selected its optimal design parameters while analyzing performance trade-offs in Matlab.
